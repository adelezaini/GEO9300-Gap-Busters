# GEO9300-Gap-Busters
Some machine learning methods (e.g., BART, LSTM, ROC/AUC curves, etc.) are explored as data-filling methods. The dataset is from an eddy covariance flux tower at Tuddal, which experienced power cuts from insufficient solar panel supply. The post-processed dataset is thus analyzed with frequency/extreme events analysis and PCA.
