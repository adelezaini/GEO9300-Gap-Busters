how do I create a synthetic dataset with python? I would like to have a time series dataset mimicing micrometeorology data. I want to have latent heat as Y and features (x values, descriptors) as different environmental and meteorological variables. I have a dataset from before, in case this would help to synthetise it.


[GPT]

Creating a synthetic dataset with similar properties to an existing dataset can be quite useful for various purposes such as testing algorithms, training machine learning models, or conducting analysis without compromising the integrity of sensitive or original data. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to generate a synthetic time series dataset for micrometeorology data using Python.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### 1. Import Required Libraries
First, install and import the necessary libraries:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.covariance import EllipticEnvelope
```

#### 2. Load the Existing Dataset
Load your existing dataset to analyze its structure and statistical properties:

```python
# Load your existing dataset (assuming it's in a CSV file)
file_path = 'your_existing_dataset.csv'
existing_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display some basic information
print(existing_data.head())
print(existing_data.describe())
```

#### 3. Extract Key Statistics
Extract key statistical properties from your existing dataset:

```python
column_names = existing_data.columns
mean = existing_data.mean()
std_dev = existing_data.std()
```

#### 4. Specify Time Period for Synthetic Data
Decide the time period and frequency for your synthetic dataset:

```python
time_period = pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-12-31', freq='H')
```

#### 5. Generate Random Data
Using the statistics from your existing dataset, generate synthetic data:

```python
synthetic_data = np.random.normal(loc=mean, scale=std_dev, size=(len(time_period), len(column_names)))

# Ensure the data is in the desired range (you can clip values if needed)
synthetic_data = np.clip(synthetic_data, a_min=0, a_max=None)
```

#### 6. Create DataFrame
Store the synthetic data in a DataFrame with appropriate column names and time indices:

```python
synthetic_df = pd.DataFrame(synthetic_data, columns=column_names, index=time_period)
print(synthetic_df.head())
```

#### 7. Add Seasonal Patterns
Optionally, add some realistic seasonal or daily patterns that mimic real-world micrometeorology data:

```python
# Example: Adding a daily oscillation to mimic diurnal patterns
daily_pattern = 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * synthetic_df.index.hour / 24)

for col in column_names:
    synthetic_df[col] += daily_pattern
```

#### 8. Ensure Data Integrity
If required, ensure the data integrity and remove any unrealistic outliers:

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
envelope = EllipticEnvelope()

# Fit scaler and normalization
scaled_synthetic_data = scaler.fit_transform(synthetic_df)
envelope.fit(scaled_synthetic_data)

# Detect and remove outliers
outlier_pred = envelope.predict(scaled_synthetic_data)
synthetic_df = synthetic_df[outlier_pred == 1]
```

#### 9. Validate Synthetic Data
Make sure to validate the synthetic data to see if it aligns with your expectations:

```python
print(synthetic_df.describe())
```

#### 10. Save the Synthetic Dataset
Finally, save the synthetic dataset to a CSV file if needed:

```python
synthetic_df.to_csv('synthetic_dataset.csv', index=True)
```

### Example Code for Complete Process

Here's the complete code put together:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.covariance import EllipticEnvelope

# Load your existing dataset
file_path = 'your_existing_dataset.csv'
existing_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Extract key statistics
column_names = existing_data.columns
mean = existing_data.mean()
std_dev = existing_data.std()

# Specify time period for synthetic data
time_period = pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-12-31', freq='H')

# Generate random data
synthetic_data = np.random.normal(loc=mean, scale=std_dev, size=(len(time_period), len(column_names)))
synthetic_data = np.clip(synthetic_data, a_min=0, a_max=None)

# Create DataFrame with time indices
synthetic_df = pd.DataFrame(synthetic_data, columns=column_names, index=time_period)

# Adding a daily oscillation to mimic diurnal patterns
daily_pattern = 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * synthetic_df.index.hour / 24)
for col in column_names:
    synthetic_df[col] += daily_pattern

# Standardize and remove outliers
scaler = StandardScaler()
envelope = EllipticEnvelope()
scaled_synthetic_data = scaler.fit_transform(synthetic_df)
envelope.fit(scaled_synthetic_data)
outlier_pred = envelope.predict(scaled_synthetic_data)
synthetic_df = synthetic_df[outlier_pred == 1]

# Save the synthetic dataset
synthetic_df.to_csv('synthetic_dataset.csv', index=True)
print('Synthetic dataset created successfully!')
```

This code should help you in creating a synthetic dataset that mimics your micrometeorology data, with `latent heat` as the `target variable` and other features as its `predictors`. Feel free to tweak the parameters and methods to better match your specific needs and dataset characteristics.


[Bruker]

can you show an example without any original observational data as well?


[GPT]

Yes, you can create a synthetic dataset from scratch without using any original observational data. This involves making reasonable assumptions about the properties and distributions of your features and target variable based on domain knowledge. Here's how you can do it step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### 1. Import Required Libraries
First, install and import the necessary libraries:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy
```

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

#### 2. Define Time Period and Frequency
Decide the time frame and frequency of your synthetic dataset:

```python
time_period = pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-12-31', freq='H')
```

#### 3. Define Feature Distributions
Create the features based on typical ranges and distributions for micrometeorology data:

```python
num_samples = len(time_period)

# Assuming 5 features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
features = {
    'temperature': np.random.normal(loc=20, scale=5, size=num_samples),  # Example: temperature in degrees Celsius
    'humidity': np.random.uniform(low=30, high=90, size=num_samples),    # Example: relative humidity in %
    'wind_speed': np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=2, size=num_samples),    # Example: wind speed in m/s
    'solar_radiation': np.random.uniform(low=0, high=1000, size=num_samples),  # Example: solar radiation in W/m^2
    'precipitation': np.random.uniform(low=0, high=10, size=num_samples) # Example: precipitation in mm
}
features_df = pd.DataFrame(features, index=time_period)
```

#### 4. Add Seasonal and Diurnal Patterns
Add seasonal and diurnal patterns to make the data more realistic:

```python
# Seasonal pattern (e.g., sinusoidal pattern for yearly seasonality)
seasonal_pattern = 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * features_df.index.dayofyear / 365)

# Diurnal pattern (e.g., daily temperature and solar radiation changes)
diurnal_pattern = 5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * features_df.index.hour / 24)

# Apply the patterns to suitable columns
features_df['temperature'] += seasonal_pattern + diurnal_pattern
features_df['solar_radiation'] *= np.maximum(0, np.sin(2 * np.pi * (features_df.index.hour - 6) / 24))  # Solar radiation peaks at noon
```

#### 5. Generate the Target Variable
Create the target variable (`latent heat`) based on a hypothetical relationship with the features:

```python
# Example: linear combination of features (with some added noise)
# Latent Heat could depend on several factors such as temperature, humidity, and solar radiation
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, num_samples)
latent_heat = 0.8 * features_df['temperature'] + 0.5 * features_df['humidity'] + 0.2 * features_df['solar_radiation'] + noise
features_df['latent_heat'] = latent_heat
```

#### 6. Validate the Synthetic Data
Check the synthetic data to ensure it looks reasonable:

```python
print(features_df.head())
print(features_df.describe())
```

#### 7. Save the Synthetic Dataset
Save the synthetic dataset to a CSV file:

```python
features_df.to_csv('synthetic_dataset_no_original_data.csv', index=True)
print('Synthetic dataset created successfully!')
```

### Complete Code Example:

Here's the complete code to create a synthetic dataset from scratch:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define time period and frequency
time_period = pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-12-31', freq='H')
num_samples = len(time_period)

# Define feature distributions
features = {
    'temperature': np.random.normal(loc=20, scale=5, size=num_samples),  # Example: temperature in degrees Celsius
    'humidity': np.random.uniform(low=30, high=90, size=num_samples),    # Example: relative humidity in %
    'wind_speed': np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=2, size=num_samples),    # Example: wind speed in m/s
    'solar_radiation': np.random.uniform(low=0, high=1000, size=num_samples),  # Example: solar radiation in W/m^2
    'precipitation': np.random.uniform(low=0, high=10, size=num_samples) # Example: precipitation in mm
}
features_df = pd.DataFrame(features, index=time_period)

# Add seasonal and diurnal patterns
seasonal_pattern = 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * features_df.index.dayofyear / 365)
diurnal_pattern = 5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * features_df.index.hour / 24)

features_df['temperature'] += seasonal_pattern + diurnal_pattern
features_df['solar_radiation'] *= np.maximum(0, np.sin(2 * np.pi * (features_df.index.hour - 6) / 24))

# Generate the target variable (latent heat)
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, num_samples)
latent_heat = 0.8 * features_df['temperature'] + 0.5 * features_df['humidity'] + 0.2 * features_df['solar_radiation'] + noise
features_df['latent_heat'] = latent_heat

# Validate synthetic data
print(features_df.head())
print(features_df.describe())

# Save the synthetic dataset
features_df.to_csv('synthetic_dataset_no_original_data.csv', index=True)
print('Synthetic dataset created successfully!')
```

This code generates a time series dataset with synthetic features based on typical micrometeorology data distributions and adds patterns to increase realism. The target variable `latent heat` is generated as a hypothetical function of the features with some added noise. Adjust the formulas and parameters to better suit your specific requirements.


[Bruker]

could you create a code for simply plotting each of the variables in a subplot for visual inspection?


[GPT]

Certainly! Visual inspection is an important step to verify that your synthetic dataset looks realistic. Below is the code to plot each variable in separate subplots using Matplotlib, one of the most commonly used plotting libraries in Python.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Plotting Subplots

#### 1. Import Required Libraries
Ensure you have `matplotlib` installed and import the necessary libraries:

```sh
pip install matplotlib
```

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

#### 2. Load the Synthetic Dataset
Load the synthetic dataset you previously created:

```python
# Load the synthetic dataset
synthetic_df = pd.read_csv('synthetic_dataset_no_original_data.csv', index_col=0, parse_dates=True)
```

#### 3. Plot Each Variable in a Subplot
Create subplots to visualize each variable. Here’s a complete script:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the synthetic dataset
synthetic_df = pd.read_csv('synthetic_dataset_no_original_data.csv', index_col=0, parse_dates=True)

# Define the number of features
num_features = len(synthetic_df.columns)

# Create subplots
fig, axs = plt.subplots(num_features, figsize=(12, 2*num_features), sharex=True)

# Loop through each column and plot
for i, column in enumerate(synthetic_df.columns):
    axs[i].plot(synthetic_df.index, synthetic_df[column], label=column)
    axs[i].set_ylabel(column)
    axs[i].legend(loc='upper right')

# Set the common x-label
plt.xlabel('Time')

# Adjust layout
plt.tight_layout()

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Import Libraries**: Import Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for plotting.
2. **Load Data**: Load the synthetic dataset from the CSV file. Make sure to parse dates and set the index column to be the date for proper time series plotting.
3. **Create Subplots**: Use `plt.subplots` to create a grid of subplots. The number of rows is equal to the number of features, and the `sharex=True` parameter ensures that all subplots share the same x-axis.
4. **Plot Each Variable**: Loop through each column of the DataFrame, plotting the time series in its respective subplot. Use `axs[i].plot` to plot the data and `axs[i].set_ylabel` to label each subplot.
5. **Set Common X-label**: Label the shared x-axis with 'Time'.
6. **Adjust Layout**: Use `plt.tight_layout()` to prevent overlapping of subplots and labels.
7. **Show Plot**: Finally, use `plt.show()` to display the plots.

### Result
Running this script will generate a series of subplots, each displaying the time series of one variable from your synthetic dataset, allowing you to visually inspect each variable for realism and patterns.


[Bruker]

I have the following code below. Can you suggest a code for plotting these variables in subplots for visual inspection? import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.covariance import EllipticEnvelope

# Load your existing dataset
existing_data = pd.read_csv("../data/Tuddal_data.csv", index_col=0, na_values=np.nan)

# Extract key statistics
column_names = existing_data.columns
mean = existing_data.mean()
std_dev = existing_data.std()

# Specify time period for synthetic data
time_period = pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-12-31', freq='H')

# Generate random data
synthetic_data = np.random.normal(loc=mean, scale=std_dev, size=(len(time_period), len(column_names)))
synthetic_data = np.clip(synthetic_data, a_min=0, a_max=None)

# Create DataFrame with time indices
synthetic_df = pd.DataFrame(synthetic_data, columns=column_names, index=time_period)

# Adding a daily oscillation to mimic diurnal patterns
daily_pattern = 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * synthetic_df.index.hour / 24)
for col in column_names:
    synthetic_df[col] += daily_pattern

# Standardize and remove outliers
scaler = StandardScaler()
envelope = EllipticEnvelope()
scaled_synthetic_data = scaler.fit_transform(synthetic_df)
envelope.fit(scaled_synthetic_data)
outlier_pred = envelope.predict(scaled_synthetic_data)
synthetic_df = synthetic_df[outlier_pred == 1]

# Save the synthetic dataset
#synthetic_df.to_csv('synthetic_dataset.csv', index=True)
#print('Synthetic dataset created successfully!')

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Create synthetic dataset
X_synthetic, y_synthetic = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=15, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

```

This code demonstrates how to create a synthetic dataset, train a machine learning model on it, and evaluate its performance. It highlights the ease of generating synthetic data for immediate model training and testing.

By leveraging synthetic data, you can overcome various limitations associated with real-world data, leading to more robust, unbiased, and efficient machine learning applications.


[Bruker]

I have the code you send earlier below. I would like to change the variables based on monthly mean values for different months so that the diurnal variation is more realistic. How do I change the code to do that? 

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define time period and frequency
time_period = pd.date_range(start='2023-09-01', end='2024-08-31', freq='30min')
num_samples = len(time_period)

# Define feature distributions
features = {
    'temperature': np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=2, size=num_samples),  # Example: temperature in degrees Celsius
    'humidity': np.random.uniform(low=30, high=90, size=num_samples),    # Example: relative humidity in %
    'wind_speed': np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=3, size=num_samples),    # Example: wind speed in m/s
    'solar_radiation': np.random.uniform(low=0, high=900, size=num_samples),  # Example: solar radiation in W/m^2
    'precipitation': np.random.uniform(low=0, high=10, size=num_samples) # Example: precipitation in mm
 #   'max_wind_speed' : 
 #   'snow_cover' : # (boolean yes/no)
 #   'LAI' : np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=2, size=num_samples)       # square area of leafs per square meter ground
}
features_df = pd.DataFrame(features, index=time_period)

# Add seasonal and diurnal patterns
seasonal_pattern = 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * features_df.index.dayofyear / 365)
diurnal_pattern = 5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * features_df.index.hour / 24)

features_df['temperature'] += seasonal_pattern + diurnal_pattern
features_df['solar_radiation'] *= np.maximum(0, np.sin(2 * np.pi * (features_df.index.hour - 6) / 24))

# Generate the target variable (latent heat)
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, num_samples)
latent_heat = 0.8 * features_df['temperature'] + 0.5 * features_df['humidity'] + 0.2 * features_df['solar_radiation'] + noise
features_df['latent_heat'] = latent_heat

# Validate synthetic data
print(features_df.head())
print(features_df.describe())

# Save the synthetic dataset
# features_df.to_csv('../data/synthetic_dataset_no_original_data.csv', index=True)
# print('Synthetic dataset created successfully!')



[GPT]

Certainly! To make the synthetic data more realistic by incorporating monthly mean values for different variables, we need to adjust the synthetic data generation process to account for monthly variations.

Here's how to modify your code to use monthly means for each variable:

1. **Define Monthly Means**: Provide realistic monthly mean values for each feature.
2. **Adjust Seasonal Patterns**: Modify the code to interpolate these monthly mean values over the year.
3. **Generate Data**: Generate the features around these monthly means instead of a static global mean.

### Modified Code

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define time period and frequency
time_period = pd.date_range(start='2023-09-01', end='2024-08-31', freq='30min')
num_samples = len(time_period)

# Define monthly mean values for each feature (example values, adjust as necessary)
monthly_means = {
    'temperature': [0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 20, 15, 5, 1],  # Example: mean temperature for each month from Sep to Aug
    'humidity': [70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 40, 50, 60, 65],  # Example: mean humidity for each month
    'wind_speed': [5, 4, 3, 4, 6, 8, 5, 6, 4, 3, 4, 5],  # Example: mean wind speed for each month
    'solar_radiation': [100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 50],  # Example: mean solar radiation for each month
    'precipitation': [5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 10, 7, 6, 5, 4, 5]  # Example: mean precipitation for each month
}

# Generate monthly means based on day of the year
def interpolate_monthly_means(monthly_means, time_period):
    monthly_interpolated = {}
    months = np.arange(12) + 1
    for feature, means in monthly_means.items():
        monthly_values = pd.Series(data=means, index=months)
        interpolated_values = monthly_values.reindex(time_period.month).interpolate('linear').ffill().bfill()
        monthly_interpolated[feature] = interpolated_values.values
    return monthly_interpolated

monthly_interpolated = interpolate_monthly_means(monthly_means, time_period)

# Define feature distributions around interpolated monthly means
features = {}
for feature in monthly_interpolated:
    features[feature] = np.random.normal(loc=monthly_interpolated[feature], scale=2, size=num_samples)

features_df = pd.DataFrame(features, index=time_period)

# Add diurnal patterns
diurnal_pattern = 5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * features_df.index.hour / 24)

features_df['temperature'] += diurnal_pattern
features_df['solar_radiation'] *= np.maximum(0, np.sin(2 * np.pi * (features_df.index.hour - 6) / 24))

# Generate the target variable (latent heat)
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, num_samples)
latent_heat = 0.8 * features_df['temperature'] + 0.5 * features_df['humidity'] + 0.2 * features_df['solar_radiation'] + noise
features_df['latent_heat'] = latent_heat

# Validate synthetic data
print(features_df.head())
print(features_df.describe())

# Save the synthetic dataset (uncomment if needed)
# features_df.to_csv('../data/synthetic_dataset_no_original_data.csv', index=True)
# print('Synthetic dataset created successfully!')
```

### Explanation:

1. **Define Monthly Means**: We have defined hypothetical monthly mean values for each variable for demonstration purposes. Adjust these to match the realistic monthly variations for your scenario.
    
2. **Interpolation of Monthly Means**: The `interpolate_monthly_means` function interpolates these monthly values for each timestamp in the time period. The time series is indexed by the month, and linear interpolation ensures smooth transitions between months.

3. **Generate Features**: Features are now generated around these interpolated monthly means using a normal distribution, adding some variation.

4. **Diurnal Patterns**: Diurnal patterns are added to temperature and solar radiation to mimic daily fluctuations.

5. **Latent Heat Generation**: The target variable latent heat is generated based on the specified relationship with added noise.

### Note:
- The example values for monthly means should be replaced with realistic values based on your domain knowledge or existing data.
- If the diurnal patterns or any other specific seasonal adjustments require fine-tuning, you might need to adjust the formulas accordingly.

This approach ensures that the synthetic data better reflects real-world monthly and diurnal variations, leading to more realistic datasets for machine learning applications.


[Bruker]

I didn't like the results from this so I prefer the code I already had with seasonality calculation. However, I would like that the diurnal temperature variation is less pronounced, how do I change that? 


[GPT]

If you want to reduce the amplitude of the diurnal temperature variation while keeping the seasonality calculation as it is, you can simply adjust the scaling factor of the diurnal pattern. In the previous code, the daily (diurnal) pattern is added using:

```python
diurnal_pattern = 5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * features_df.index.hour / 24)
```

To reduce the diurnal variation, you should decrease the scaling factor (in this case, 5). For example, changing the scaling factor to 2 will reduce the amplitude of the diurnal temperature variation.

### Modified Code

Here's the updated code with a reduced diurnal temperature variation:

```python
import numpy as np

### Explanation:

1. **Reduce Diurnal Pattern Amplitude**: The `diurnal_pattern` is now scaled by 2 instead of 5:
    ```python
    diurnal_pattern = 2 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * features_df.index.hour / 24)
    ```
    This reduces the diurnal temperature variation, making the daily temperature swings less pronounced.

2. **Apply Patterns**: The seasonal pattern remains as it is, while the updated diurnal pattern with reduced amplitude is applied to the `temperature`.

### Visualization

Visual inspection will help confirm the reduced diurnal variation. You can use the subplot visualization code provided earlier to plot the resulting synthetic dataset.

### Summary

By adjusting the scaling factor of the diurnal pattern, you can control the extent to which temperature fluctuates on a daily basis. This approach allows for fine-tuning of the synthetic data to better match realistic conditions based on your specific requirements.


[Bruker]

Can you add a term for the different variable to adjust the amount of noise (residuals)?


[GPT]

Certainly! Adding a term to adjust the amount of noise (residuals) for each feature can make your synthetic data more flexible and realistic. This can be particularly useful if you want to simulate different levels of measurement noise or variability for different features.

### Modified Code with Adjustable Noise

Here's the updated code including a noise term for each feature:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define time period and frequency
time_period = pd.date_range(start='2023-09-01', end='2024-08-31', freq='30min')
num_samples = len(time_period)

# Define feature distributions with adjustable noise
feature_means = {
    'temperature': 20,  # Mean temperature in degrees Celsius
    'humidity': 60,    # Mean relative humidity in %
    'wind_speed': 5,   # Mean wind speed in m/s
    'solar_radiation': 450,  # Mean solar radiation in W/m^2
    'precipitation': 1  # Mean precipitation in mm
}
feature_stds = {
    'temperature': 2,   # Std deviation for temperature
    'humidity': 10,     # Std deviation for humidity
    'wind_speed': 1,    # Std deviation for wind speed
    'solar_radiation': 100,    # Std deviation for solar radiation
    'precipitation': 0.5  # Std deviation for precipitation
}

# Generate features based on monthly means and additional noise
features = {}
for feature in feature_means:
    base = np.random.normal(loc=feature_means[feature], scale=feature_stds[feature], size=num_samples)
    seasonal_pattern = 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * time_period.dayofyear / 365)
    diurnal_pattern = 2 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * time_period.hour / 24)
    
    if feature == 'temperature':
        features[feature] = base + seasonal_pattern + diurnal_pattern
    elif feature == 'solar_radiation':
        features[feature] = base * np.maximum(0, np.sin(2 * np.pi * (time_period.hour - 6) / 24))
    else:
        features[feature] = base

features_df = pd.DataFrame(features, index=time_period)

# Add noise term to the features
for feature in features:
    noise = np.random.normal(0, feature_stds[feature], num_samples)
    features_df[feature] += noise

# Generate the target variable (latent heat) with additional noise term
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, num_samples)
latent_heat_noise = 0.5  # Adjustable noise term for latent heat
latent_heat = 0. * features_df['temperature'] + 0.5 * features_df['humidity'] + 0.2 * features_df['solar_radiation'] + latent_heat_noise * noise
features_df['latent_heat'] = latent_heat

# Validate synthetic data
print(features_df.head())
print(features_df.describe())

# Uncomment if you want to save the synthetic dataset
# features_df.to_csv('../data/synthetic_dataset_no_original_data.csv', index=True)
# print('Synthetic dataset created successfully!')

# Plot for visual inspection
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

num_features = len(features_df.columns)

# Create subplots
fig, axs = plt.subplots(num_features, figsize=(12, 2*num_features), sharex=True)

# Loop through each column and plot
for i, column in enumerate(features_df.columns):
    axs[i].plot(features_df.index, features_df[column], label=column)
    axs[i].set_ylabel(column)
    axs[i].legend(loc='upper right')

# Set the common x-label
plt.xlabel('Time')

# Adjust layout
plt.tight_layout()

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Define Means and Standard Deviations**: Dictionaries `feature_means` and `feature_stds` store the mean and standard deviation for each feature.
   
2. **Generate Base Features**: Features are generated based on these mean and standard deviation values. Separate noise patterns (`seasonal_pattern` and `diurnal_pattern`) are added to these features.

3. **Apply Patterns**: Seasonal and diurnal patterns are specifically added to temperature and solar radiation, to better match realistic conditions.

4. **Add Noise Term**: Additional noise specific to each feature is added using a normal distribution, whose standard deviation is defined in `feature_stds`. This noise simulates measurement or environmental variability.

5. **Target Variable (Latent Heat)**: The target variable is generated using the features and their respective noise terms. An additional noise term (`latent_heat_noise`) is added to simulate variability in latent heat measurements.

6. **Visualization**: Adding a plotting section at the end for visual inspection of each feature over time.

### Customizing Noise:

- You can tune the `feature_stds` values to control the level of noise for each feature.
- The `latent_heat_noise` term can also be adjusted to control the noise in the target variable.

This approach gives you greater control over the synthetic data generation process, making it possible to simulate realistic variability and noise in the dataset.


[Bruker]

This site should be at a latitude of 60 degrees. This means that the radiation should be lower and shorter daytime in winter and longer in summer. Can you mimic this in the dataset by adding a constant for the latitude, i.e. radiation annual and diurnal cycle?


[GPT]

Certainly! To make the solar radiation data more realistic for a site at 60 degrees latitude, you'll need to consider the seasonal variations in daylight hours. At this latitude, the length of daylight varies significantly between summer and winter. In winter, daylight hours are short, while in summer, they are long and intense.

To mimic this in the dataset, we need to adjust solar radiation based on the day of the year and the latitude. A simple way to model this is by using the solar declination angle and the day length as factors that influence the radiation.

### Steps to Adjust Solar Radiation:

1. **Calculate Daily Solar Radiation**: Adjust the daily solar radiation based on the day of the year to mimic higher radiation in summer and lower in winter.
2. **Calculate the Diurnal Pattern**: Further adjust the diurnal pattern based on the calculated daily maximum and the position of the sun.

Here's the modified code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def solar_declination(day_of_year):
    return 23.44 * np.sin(np.radians(360 / 365.24 * (day_of_year - 81)))

### Explanation:

1. **Solar Declination and Day Length Calculation**:
   - `solar_declination(day_of_year)`: Calculates the solar declination angle based on the day of the year.
   - `day_length(day_of_year, latitude)`: Computes the length of the day in hours based on the solar declination and the latitude.

2. **Apply Seasonal and Diurnal Patterns**:
   - The seasonal variation of solar radiation is modeled to peak in summer and be lowest in winter.
   - Day length is incorporated by zeroing out radiation during nighttime based on the calculated day length for the given latitude.

3. **Adjusting Solar Radiation**:
   - Solar radiation peaks around solar noon and is zero outside of daylight hours.
   - Seasonal variations cause the maximum radiation to be higher in summer and lower in winter, reflecting longer days in summer and shorter days in winter.

This code should better mimic the solar radiation patterns expected at a latitude of 60 degrees, with shorter low-radiation days in winter and longer high-radiation days in summer.


[Bruker]

than you, i think hte following line is wrong, can you have an edit of the code to correct for it? 
if hour_of_day < (24 - day_length_hours) / 2 or_of_day > 24 - (24 - day_length_hours) / 2:



[GPT]

You're correct. There is a typo in that line. The correct condition should be checking if the `hour_of_day` is outside of the daylight hours. Specifically, it should check if the `hour_of_day` is less than the morning start of daylight or greater than the evening end of daylight.

The corrected condition is:

```python
if hour_of_day < (24 - day_length_hours) / 2 or hour_of_day > 24 - (24 - day_length_hours) / 2:
```

Here's the updated and corrected line of code within the context of the solar radiation calculation:

### Explanation of Changes:

- Updated the condition to properly check if `hour_of_day` is within the daylight hours:
  ```python
  if hour_of_day < (24 - day_length_hours) / 2 or hour_of_day > 24 - (24 - day_length_hours) / 2:
  ```

This ensures that solar radiation is set to zero outside the calculated daylight hours for each day of the year, more accurately reflecting the variations in day length at a latitude of 60 degrees.

Using this code, the synthetic dataset will better reflect the shorter days with lower radiation during winter and longer days with higher radiation during summer, along with a more accurate diurnal pattern.


[Bruker]

I want to have some randomness to the solar radiation, reflecting for instance cloudy days. This should in turn also influence the temperature: When it is cloudy during day in summer, it should be warmer. When it is cloudy during night, it should be slightly warmer. If it is cloudy in winter, it should be slightly warmer. 


[GPT]

To introduce randomness to the solar radiation reflecting cloudy days and its influence on temperature, we can make the following modifications:

1. **Random Cloudiness Factor**: Introduce a cloudiness factor that varies between 0 (completely sunny) and 1 (completely overcast) for each day.
2. **Modify Solar Radiation**: Adjust the solar radiation based on the cloudiness factor.
3. **Influence Temperature**: Modify the temperature based on the cloudiness factor, considering the time of day and season.

### Modified Code

Here is the code incorporating the above changes:

```python

### Key Changes:

1. **Cloudiness Factor**:
   - Introduced a `cloudiness_factor` array, where each value between 0 (clear) and 1 (overcast) represents the cloudiness for each timestamp.

2. **Modify Solar Radiation**:
   - Adjusted the `solar_radiation` based on the cloudiness factor.
   - Radiation is zero outside of daylight hours. During daylight, it is reduced according to the cloudiness factor.

3. **Temperature Adjustments**:
   - Added a temperature adjustment based on cloudiness:
     - During the day in summer, clouds reduce the temperature.
     - During other times (night or non-summer months), clouds increase the temperature slightly.

4. **Add Noise**:
   - Added the respective noise to each feature.

This approach ensures that the generated synthetic dataset includes random variations in solar radiation due to cloudiness and the corresponding temperature adjustments, making the data more realistic for your specific scenario.

### Explanation:

- **User-defined Parameters**:
  - **params dictionary**: Contains all the commonly adjusted parameters (latitude, start and end dates, frequency, feature means and standard deviations, seasonal and diurnal amplitudes, and latent heat noise). This makes it easy to modify the main parameters at the top of the script.

- **Functions**:
  - **solar_declination**: Calculates the solar declination angle.
  - **day_length**: Calculates day length based on solar declination and latitude.

- **Main Code**:
  - **Generate Features**: Features are generated based on user-defined means and standard deviations, with seasonal and diurnal patterns added.
  - **Calculate Solar Radiation**: Solar radiation is computed considering the cloudiness factor to introduce variability for cloudy days.
  - **Adjust Temperature**: Temperature adjustment based on cloudiness, with different rules for day/night and summer/winter conditions.
  - **Add Noise**: Applies random noise to each feature to simulate measurement variability.
  - **Generate Latent Heat**: Computes the latent heat using a linear combination of the features and added noise.

- **Validation and Plotting**:
  - **Prints the first few rows and describes the dataset** to validate the generated synthetic data.
  - **Plots each feature**: Places the plots in subplots for visual inspection.

This code structure should be easier to modify and understand, with all important parameters defined at the top.

1. **User-defined Parameters**: Add parameters for the average number of rainy days per month for a year.

### Explanation:

1. **User-defined Parameters**:
   - Added `average_rainy_days_per_month` in the `params` dictionary for each month.

2. **Functions**:
   - `generate_rainy_days(num_days, avg_rainy_days)`: Generates an array where rainy days are marked as `1` based on the average number of rainy days per month.

3. **Rainy Days Generation**:
   - For each month, generate the rainy days based on the average number of rainy days provided.
   - Combine the monthly rainy days into a continuous array, repeated for half-hourly data (`rainy_hours`).

4. **Adjust Precipitation**:
   - Modified precipitation values based on whether a given period is rainy or not. If it's a rainy day, random precipitation values are generated.

5. **Add Noise and Target Generation**:
   - Added noise to other features.
   - Generated the `latent_heat` target variable as before.

6. **Validation and Plotting**:
   - Printed the first few rows and described the dataset for validation.
   - Created subplots for visual inspection of each feature over time.

This code provides more realistic simulation of rainy days and their impact on precipitation, taking monthly averages into account.


[Bruker]

can you change the code so that the hours of rain correspond to cloudiness? If precipitation occurs, cloudiness factor should be 1. However, it should still be days when it is cloudy but no precipitation.

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Cloudiness Factor Adjustment**:
   - `effective_cloudiness = max(0.5 * cloudiness_factor[i], rainy_hours[i]) if rainy_hours[i] == 1 else cloudiness_factor[i]`: Ensures that the cloudiness factor is set to 1 whenever it is raining but allows for some random cloudiness when it is not raining.

2. **Temperature Adjustment Based on Cloudiness and Rain**:
   - The temperature adjustments are applied based on the effective cloudiness factor. If it's cloudy and/or rainy, appropriate temperature adjustments are made.

3. **Precipitation Adjustment**:
   - Precipitation values are generated only for the rainy hours.

4. **Add Noise**:
   - Applied noise to all features except for `precipitation` and `solar_radiation`, which have their special adjustments.

This approach ensures that periods with precipitation are always cloudy, while there can still be cloudy periods without precipitation, creating a more realistic synthetic dataset.

[GPT]

The error you're seeing occurs when the number of rainy days exceeds the number of days in a month. This can happen when trying to randomly select more rainy days than there are days available in the month (e.g., trying to have 31 rainy days in February).

To resolve this, we need to ensure that the number of rainy days does not exceed the number of days in the month. Let's adjust the code accordingly:

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Adjust Number of Rainy Days**:
   - `actual_rainy_days = min(num_days, avg_rainy_days)`: Ensures that the number of rainy days does not exceed the number of days in the month.

2. **Cloudiness Factor Adjustment**:
   - `effective_cloudiness = 1 if rainy_hours[i] == 1 else cloudiness_factor[i]`: Ensures that the cloudiness factor is set to 1 whenever it is raining, but uses the original random cloudiness factor when it is not raining.

These changes should help in resolving the errors and ensuring that the synthetic data generated is more realistic, with cloudiness corresponding to rainy hours and some cloudy periods without precipitation.


[Bruker]

 want the rainy days to occur randomly. However, the likelihood of several days of precipitation in a row should be 70%.


[GPT]

To simulate rainy days occurring randomly with a higher likelihood of consecutive rainy days, we can use a simple probabilistic approach. Specifically, we can model the likelihood of a rainy day following another rainy day. This can be achieved using a Markov chain-like model.

Here's how we can incorporate this into the existing code:

1. **Define Parameters**: Set the probability of a rainy day occurring after another rainy day (e.g., 70%).
2. **Generate Rainy Days**: Use a probabilistic approach to generate rainy days based on the defined probability.
3. **Adjust Cloudiness Based on Rain**: Ensure that cloudiness corresponds to rainy hours and maintain some cloudy periods without precipitation.

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Rainy Days Generation**:
   - `generate_rainy_days(num_days, avg_rainy_days, transition_probability)`: This function generates rainy days with a given average number of rainy days per month and a probability that a rainy day will be followed by another rainy day.
   - Uses an initial selection of rainy days and then iterates to potentially extend rainy periods based on the transition probability.

2. **Cloudiness Factor Adjustment**:
   - `effective_cloudiness = 1 if rainy_hours[i] == 1 else cloudiness_factor[i]`: Ensures that the cloudiness factor is set to 1 whenever it is raining, while allowing randomness in cloudiness on non-rainy days.

These modifications should help achieve the desired effect of having consecutive rainy days with a certain probability, while also reflecting the impact on cloudiness and other weather variables.


[Bruker]

I also don't want a complete reduction in irradiance when cloud factor = 1. It should be reduced by 70%.


[GPT]

Certainly! Let's update the code so that when the cloudiness factor is 1 (indicating it is raining or fully cloudy), the solar radiation is reduced by 70% instead of being set to zero. 

Here’s how the updated code would look:

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Reduction Factor for Solar Radiation**:
   - Introduced a `reduction_factor` which is `0.7` when the cloudiness factor is `1` (indicating full cloudiness or rain), and `1 - effective_cloudiness` otherwise. This ensures that solar radiation is reduced by 70% when fully cloudy or rainy, but scales linearly with partial cloudiness.
   - The adjustment for solar radiation is done in the loop where it is calculated:
     ```python
     reduction_factor = 0.7 if effective_cloudiness == 1 else 1 - effective_cloudiness
     radiation = max_radiation * max(0, np.sin(hour_angle)) * reduction_factor
     ```

2. **Other Adjustments**:
   - The temperature adjustment based on cloudiness and rainy conditions remains the same, since we are still considering the cloudiness effect on temperature.

### Summary:
- The solar radiation is now only reduced by 70% under full cloudiness or rainy conditions, rather than being set to zero.
- This produces a more realistic model where there is still some irradiance observed even on fully cloudy or rainy days.


[Bruker]

precipitation, wind speed, and humidity cannot go under 0. Please fix this in hte code. 


[GPT]

Sure! We can add constraints to ensure that precipitation, wind speed, and humidity values do not fall below zero. This can be done using `np.clip`, which will allow us to specify the minimum value as zero.

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Clip Values to Ensure Non-Negativity**:
   - Added `np.clip` to ensure that `precipitation`, `humidity`, and `wind_speed` do not fall below zero.
   - These lines are added just before generating the target variable:
     ```python
     features_df['precipitation'] = np.clip(features_df['precipitation'], 0, None)
     features_df['humidity'] = np.clip(features_df['humidity'], 0, None)
     features_df['wind_speed'] = np.clip(features_df['wind_speed'], 0, None)
     ```

By applying `np.clip`, we ensure that the specified variables do not take on negative values, which is not physically meaningful for these variables. This adjustment will ensure that the generated synthetic dataset is more realistic and adheres to the constraints for these environmental variables.
